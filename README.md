# they-ignored-my-issue

A repo to keep a track of GitHub issues that were closed because the owners were too busy to care.

## Project/Vendor lists

* [Microsoft](./Microsoft.md)

## Background

Have you ever opened a GitHub issue with a project only for it to be closed with no good reason?
This happened to me in [this](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/issues/103892) Microsoft documentation issue. This wasnt the first time a GitHub project had done this to me.

## Reason for this repo

* Mainly as a place I can park these issues for future reference.
* Also as a place for others to share their similar experiences.

## Contributing

Will take PRs as requests to add similar incidents.
